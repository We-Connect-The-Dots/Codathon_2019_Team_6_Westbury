<img src="https://observer.ug/images/World-Aids-Day.jpg" width="760" height="405">

<p>23.8 million people in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa have HIV and 91% of the world's population of children with HIV live in Africa. The disease of HIV attacks the body's white blood cells, which are the main defense of the immunse system. This makes the body more succeptible to other diseases which makes its effects even worse in an area with many other deadly diseases, such as Africa. This is why the AIDS fighting efforts are majorly focused in Africa. Without treatment with HIV medicines, HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though it may advance faster in some people.</p>
